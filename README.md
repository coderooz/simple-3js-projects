# Simple 3js Projects

This project is a collection of 3D modeling projects created using Three.js, inspired by the YouTube tutorial series "[Learn Three.js by building 5 projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMqNHi1GDAE&t=32s&pp=ygUlbGVhcm4gdGhyZWUuanMgYnkgYnVpbGRpbmcgNSBwcm9qZWN0cw%3D%3D)" by FreeCodeCamp.

## Projects Included

This repository contains the following projects:

1. **Getting Started Project**: A basic introduction to Three.js, covering fundamental concepts and setup.
   
2. **Earth Map**: A project that showcases a 3D representation of the Earth, demonstrating the use of textures and interactivity in Three.js.
